This page is here to talk about several pieces of music that I've really enjoyed playing in band.

 1. [Irish Tune from County Derry][irish] is a really slow and beautiful piece that gets stuck in my head a lot.
 2. [Festive Overture][festive] by Shostakovich is the most fun I've ever had playing a piece.
 3. [Southarn Harmony Part 3][southern] I just like this one because I got to clap.
