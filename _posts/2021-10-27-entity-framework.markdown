This tutorial actually went much more smoothly than the previous lab. I managed to get through most things with very few issues,
and the tutorial was just incredibly long since so much was being done throughout. This lab probably took me almost as long as lab 7
just because of how long it was. I luckily didn't struggle working with multiple tables because the way they were presented was very
easily understandable and fairly intuitive.

This lab has made me feel much more confident on the final project and I feel like our client's goals will be managable with the
knowledge I have now and I'm looking forward to starting work on the project.
