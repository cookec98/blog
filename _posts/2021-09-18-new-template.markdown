The editing and rearranging of things is always somewhat easier than downloading them, so I didn't struggle much with this new stuff.
I've never done any of it before, but because of the clear instructions, and also because of the [Documentation][jekyll] on Jekyll's
themes I didn't struggle for very long. The hardest part was finding minima, but thankfully I found this command to help me.

Everything else was fairly smooth sailing except for when the internet died for several hours but I guess that doesn't really count.
It's really fun to just mess around with html and css, and writing posts in markdown is the same way. Messing around with the results
of [Lab 2][quiz] is entertaining and fun and that makes me really proud of it.

I don't really have anything else to say but i need another picture, so here's my best friend's cat.
