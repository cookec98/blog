Most of the lab seemed relatively easy at a first glance, and it even felt like i was blowing through it at an incredibly fast speed.
But obviously all good things must come to an end so eventually I got to the point where I had to upload the updated database to
Azure and use it in my site. The wifi not allowing me to update the database in the way that I needed obviously causes a lot of
problems and I flailed around for hours trying to find a solution including basically redoing the whole project twice.

We worked on the start of the lab together, but we quickly realized that we were kinda behind on our project so that took priority
over the lab and I did the rest of the lab on my own. Unfortunately I was not able to get the database working online because of
the internet issues but here is the [link][azure] to what did get uploaded to azure
