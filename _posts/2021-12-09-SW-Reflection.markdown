I would just like to start this reflection by stating just how much I thought this project was an incredibly interesting and unique experience
that feels really cool to be a part of. Working with Indivisible Arkansas has been really enjoyable and I think it has also heavily improved
my teamwork abilities in a computer science setting.

The most important skills for this project, and also the ones that I need to work on the most going forward are group planning and teamwork.
Figuring out how to split the work that needs to be done into small and easier to manage pieces as well as ensuring that nobody is working
on the same thing at the same time. This definitely took a while to figure out, but once we got going the workflow became natural because of
how well everything had been split up. This is something that I for sure need to work on and I think Josh kinda carried the group through a
lot of that but I'm getting better and it's a really important skill to have going into the future.

Indivisible Arkansas is also just a really great cause to be working for. Helping with voter registration is a very noble and important cause,
so I think what Indivisible is doing is really amazing and I think they're a great nonprofit. The information they provide to possible voters is
very useful in promoting democracy and higher voting numbers which I believe can make significant social and political change, and Indivisible is
a very good cause for this reason.

I wouldnt say that any of my fundamental beliefs have been challenged or confirmed, but it feels really amazing to make something so big and cool
like this that can genuinely effect the world even if only in a small way. I think this feeling is probably my biggest takeaway from this project,
just the amazing feeling of being able to make a positive change in the world and have more of an effect on the world than "I spend money therefore
I effect the economy." This is a really cool and unique feeling and I'm really appreciative to have had the opportunity to work on this project.
