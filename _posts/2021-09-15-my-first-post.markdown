My experience downloading [Ruby][ruby] and all of the necessary bits and pieces to start this blog was a bit complicated and tricky. Over the past few years I've said to some of my friends from time to time jokingly that installing a coding language is the hardest part of computer science, and Ruby did its best to continue proving me right. I struggled with a missing file during the bundle installation, so I decided to delete Ruby and try to download it again. I'm not exactly sure what I did differently, but I managed to get it working the second time. Another big thing that happened was 'jekyll serve' not working because of a missing file known as 'webrick', which I quickly learned was only included in previous versions of Ruby and not version 3.0 that I used. I fixed that issue thanks to a [Github Issue][github-issue].

Some things I am looking forward to with this blog and this class are.

  1. Using markdown to easily make posts like these and include links and stylization easily.
  2. Continuing to build my knowledge of how to use html and css to make websites.
  3. Doing a project on a scale larger than I have ever done before.
